# Quotables
## Quotables - Collect you favourite quotes!
Everyone must have their own list of quotations because favourite quotes serve to define a person rather quickly, which helps others who resonate at the same frequencies realize that we share perspectives. But collecting quotes and maintaining it in a single platform is very difficult. **Quotables** being a web application, anyone can save their favourite quotes anytime, anywhere by just creating an account in the website. Therefore, a person may no longer waste his/her time in searching for his/her favourite quotes.
